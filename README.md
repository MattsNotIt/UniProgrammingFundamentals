Challenge 1 was very simple. By honing in my artistic skills, I was able to draw out a boat using ascii art.

This took me 2 attempts as the first time I did it, I realised that my code was terrible. This made me want to rewrite it to be a little more readable.

Even though I rewrote it, this still took less time that drawing out the boat using just text.

This didn't take too long as I was able to use the premade (fabs, pow, sqrt, floor, ceil, and round) inside of the cmath library.

To prevent somebody writing regular text instead of an integer or a float, you can create a failsafe.

The reason there are 5 different screenshots is because I am showing the different stages of the program. I decided to iterate instead of trying to do it all in one. This one took me the longest because it took me a second to wrap around the instructions.

This shows that when you either leave the string blank or just spaces, it will produce an error using cerr.
