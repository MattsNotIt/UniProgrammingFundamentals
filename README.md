Challenge 1 was very simple. By honing in my artistic skills, I was able to draw out a boat using ascii art.

Challenge 2 - Inputting Player Details

This took me 2 attempts as the first time I did it, I realised that my code was terrible. This made me want to rewrite it to be a little more readable.

Even though I rewrote it, this still took less time that drawing out the boat using just text.

This didn't take too long as I was able to use the premade (fabs, pow, sqrt, floor, ceil, and round) inside of the cmath library.

To prevent somebody writing regular text instead of an integer or a float, you can create a failsafe.

Challenge 4 - Text Boxes

The reason there are 5 different screenshots is because I am showing the different stages of the program. I decided to iterate instead of trying to do it all in one. This one took me the longest because it took me a second to wrap around the instructions.

This shows that when you either leave the string blank or just spaces, it will produce an error using cerr.

Text Based Adventure

For this text based game, I decided that instead of making a regular small game, I would try and make this as big as I possibly could just for the fun of it.

To start off with, I made a "skeleton" of the game where I have multiple functions that I can call from the main game loop in the main function. This means that from here, I can easily add on the the game instead of having to rewrite everything each time.

This is the first example of the game. It starts you off with some text explaining who you are and the player is given a list of commands to play around with.

When the user clicks play, the first thing the program does, is create a random seed for the game as I want this to be random each time you play it. It will have a structure of a sentence and will have different words and locations and objects to randomly select from to keep the game different.

I am also experimenting with new data types that I have never had the chance to use before. This is a map. As seen in the comment, this allows you to essentially create a pair. It's like looking at a burger on a menu and in smaller text underneath, it says it comes with fries. In that case, the fries are the pair with the burger. It is that added extra on the the previously single variable.

So far, all of these commands work but are lacking content (as previously mentioned, it is the skeleton of the game right now)
